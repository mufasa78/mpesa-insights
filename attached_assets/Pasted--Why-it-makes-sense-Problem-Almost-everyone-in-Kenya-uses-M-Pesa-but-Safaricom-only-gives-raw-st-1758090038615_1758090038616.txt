✅ Why it makes sense

Problem: Almost everyone in Kenya uses M-Pesa, but Safaricom only gives raw statements (CSV/PDF) that are hard to analyze. People know money is “disappearing,” but can’t see where.

Solution: A webapp (or Windows app) that parses M-Pesa statements and generates:

Expense categories (Food, Transport, Entertainment, Utilities, etc.)

Zone-based highlights (high spend → low spend)

Filters (by date, by type, by paybill, by till number, etc.)

Insights: “You spent 38% on food this month, down 5% from last month.”

🛠 How you can build it (no AI, just Python power)

Statement ingestion

Safaricom exports statements as PDF or CSV.

You parse CSV directly with pandas.

If PDF, you can use pdfplumber or camelot to extract tables.

Transaction cleaning

Columns: Date, Details, Amount, Type (Send, Paybill, Till, Withdraw, Receive, etc.).

Normalize all amounts to float, ensure consistent column names.

Categorization

Use simple rule-based classification, not AI.

Keywords in Details:

"Uber" → Transport

"Naivas, Carrefour, Quickmart" → Groceries

"KPLC, Zuku, Safaricom" → Utilities

For unknown paybills/tills, let user assign category once and store mappings in a JSON/db for reuse.

Analytics

Monthly totals by category → bar chart/pie chart.

High-to-low expense ranking → sorted table.

Trends over time → line chart.

Optional: set budget thresholds → flag overspending.

Filters & UI

Filter by date range, category, transaction type, amount range.

Export summary to CSV/PDF.

🌐 Deployment options

Webapp (recommended first):

Use Flask or FastAPI backend.

UI with React (since you’re already doing Next.js work) or just Streamlit for a quick prototype.

Desktop GUI:

Use Tkinter or PyQt5.

Bundle with PyInstaller into a .exe for Windows.

🤝 Open source + Monetization path

Open source: Start on GitHub. Share as “personal finance for M-Pesa users.” It will attract attention (a lot of people want this).

Monetization later:

Premium hosted version (no need to install anything).

Add features like SMS parsing, multi-wallet, goal tracking.

Partnerships with SACCOs or budgeting tools.

📊 Example output

Imagine uploading your CSV and getting:

Summary for August 2025

Groceries: KSh 12,450 (38%)

Transport: KSh 5,200 (16%)

Utilities: KSh 4,000 (12%)

Airtime/Data: KSh 2,300 (7%)

Entertainment: KSh 1,800 (6%)

Misc: KSh 6,000 (21%)

Biggest spend zone: Groceries
You spent 14% more than last month on Transport.
