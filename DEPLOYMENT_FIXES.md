# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Server Address Configuration ✅
**Problem**: Streamlit config was set to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
**Fix**: Changed to `0.0.0.0` in `.streamlit/config.toml` to accept external connections

### 2. Missing Dependencies ✅
**Problem**: `numpy` was used extensively but not in `requirements.txt`
**Fix**: Added `numpy>=1.24.0` to requirements.txt

### 3. Health Check Configuration ✅
**Problem**: Basic health check configuration
**Fix**: 
- Enhanced Docker health check with proper intervals and retries
- Updated Fly.io health check to use `/_stcore/health` endpoint
- Increased timeout from 5s to 10s

### 4. Deployment Scripts ✅
**Problem**: Generic deployment commands
**Fix**: Updated both `deploy.sh` and `deploy.bat` to specify the app name explicitly

## Files Modified

1. **`.streamlit/config.toml`**
   - Changed `address = "127.0.0.1"` to `address = "0.0.0.0"`

2. **`requirements.txt`**
   - Added `numpy>=1.24.0`

3. **`Dockerfile`**
   - Enhanced health check with proper intervals and retries

4. **`fly.toml`**
   - Updated health check path to `/_stcore/health`
   - Increased timeout to 10s

5. **`deploy.sh` and `deploy.bat`**
   - Added explicit app name: `--app mpesa-insights`

## New Files Created

1. **`test_deployment.py`**
   - Pre-deployment test script to catch issues locally
   - Tests all imports and module loading

## Next Steps

1. **Test Locally First**:
   ```bash
   python test_deployment.py
   ```

2. **Deploy with Fixed Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   ./deploy.sh
   
   # Windows
   deploy.bat
   ```

3. **Monitor Deployment**:
   ```bash
   fly logs --app mpesa-insights
   fly status --app mpesa-insights
   ```

## Common 502 Error Causes (Now Fixed)

- ❌ Server binding to localhost instead of 0.0.0.0
- ❌ Missing Python dependencies (numpy)
- ❌ Import errors in Python modules
- ❌ Health check failures
- ❌ Port configuration mismatches

All of these issues have been addressed in the fixes above.
